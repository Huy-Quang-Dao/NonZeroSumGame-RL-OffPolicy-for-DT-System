# [Matlab] Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Nonzero-Sum Game Discrete-time System

## Introduction
This is my simulation for the Algorithm described in **Data-Driven Nonzero-Sum Game for Discrete-Time Systems Using Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning** [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8933509).

## Experiments:
I used a different original control matrix than the article.
